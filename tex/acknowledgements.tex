Many people have been supporters and champions in my PhD journey. Chief among these are my two co-supervisors. Martha White and Adam White have been giant figures in my growth as a researcher and educator since my initial work in machine learning and reinforcement learning at Indiana University. Their support and mentorship has been invaluable. I am deeply grateful for being a part of their labs for the past several years, and I will miss the engaging research they perform.

I am thankful to my committee---Michael Bowling, Matthew Guzdial, and
Andres Barretto---for engaging with my research and providing valuable
feedback to make my research better. I am Also, I want to thank all the collaborators of the work presented in this thesis: Andrew Jacobsen, Andy Patterson, Zaheer Abbas, Wesley Chung, Daniel Graves, Jian Qian, and Volodymyr Tkachuk. Your contributions have made this thesis significantly better. I look forward to working together in the future and continuing to be colleagues and friends. 

While my co-supervisors have been amazing mentors, many
fellow students and colleagues have made the University of Alberta a fun and intellectually exciting place to do a Ph.D. Special appreciation goes to Alex Kearney for the continued support, friendship, and smart-witty banter that made the hard times fly by. There is always time for
(gluten-free) pasta, especially at 1 a.m. in Toronto. I also want to thank Andrew Jacobsen for his consistent stream of challenging music suggestions, his eccentric and exciting behavior at drinks, and his friendship through the years. I want to thank Shibhansh Dohare for getting me deeply embedded in the climbing world and making exercise in the last few years of my Ph.D. enjoyable. Also, thank you to Eric Graves for being a great introduction to the department and for being an old man with me when we both threw our backs out. I also want to acknowledge Marlos Machado and Craig Sherston for being role models as senior Ph.D. students. Especially Marlos for the early morning conversations and advice in the first year of my degree. I
also want to acknowledge Johannes G\"unther for his friendship and
mentorship in doing research and finding my voice as a person and researcher. Many thanks also to Andy Patterson and Cam Linke (along with AJ) for the many fun conversations and drinks throughout the years, Roshan Shariff for his wisdom and engaging discourse on anything in mathematics, Raksha Kumaraswamy for being desk neighbors both here and at Indiana University, Yangchen Pan for his mentorship and
encouragement in my first research project. I want to send my appreciation and thanks to J. Fernando Hernandez Garcia Abhishek Naik, Khurram Javed, Niko Yasui, Revan MacQueen, Sacha Davis, Tian Tian, Kenny Young, Blanca Miller, Dylan Brenneis, Andy Wong, Brian Tanner, James Bell, Banafsheh Rafiee, Kirby Banman, Alex Lewandowski, Connor Stephens, Aidan Bush, and Chunlok Lo.

Finally, I want to thank my family and friends (those outside the
department) for supporting me through these tumultuous years. Fred and
LaVonn Schlegel for being my biggest supporters and advocates, Sarah
Nagelvoort for being not only a sister but a friend, mentor, and
listening post, Mark Nagelvoort for being the best brother-in-law
ever, and Henry and Evelyn Nagelvoort for letting me play with their
toys when I'm in Bloomington. I also want to thank Roshni Sajiv Kumar
for her support and partnership. Thank you to Dan Kenneally, Pat Miller,
and Ed Cowie for being great friends for an uncountable number of
years. And thank you to the rest of my extended family. You all have
given me the space and encouragement to grow into who I am
today. Finally, I want to thank the Doctors who diagnosed my sister
with Celiac disease, leading to my gluten-free life. And finally,
Jonathan Song for his help in a difficult time.

My work was mad possible by the generous support of IVADO, and the
Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii). Computing resources
were provided by Compute Canada (now Digital Research Alliance of
Canada).
